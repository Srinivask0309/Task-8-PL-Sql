3 Key Insights:
1. Customer Concentration & Revenue Distribution
A small percentage of customers likely generate a large portion of total revenue (classic 80/20 rule)
Action: Implement customer segmentation - focus retention efforts on high-value customers and upsell opportunities to medium-tier customers to increase their lifetime value
2. Regional Performance Disparities
Different regions show varying profitability margins despite similar sales volumes
Action: Investigate operational efficiency differences between regions - the region with lower profit margins may have higher shipping costs, discounts, or operational inefficiencies that need optimization
3. Seasonal & Monthly Patterns
Month-over-month growth shows volatility, indicating seasonal demand fluctuations
Action: Plan inventory and staffing based on seasonal peaks and troughs; implement promotional campaigns during low-growth months to smooth revenue
